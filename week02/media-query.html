            </h2>
            <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath 
                commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of 
                men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p>

            <p>I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my 
                father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great 
                knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.</p>
